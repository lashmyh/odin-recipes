    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cross between banana bread and a drizzle cake, this easy banana loaf recipe is a quick bake that can be frozen. It's great for using up overripe bananas, too.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>140g butter</li>
        <li>140g caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>140g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 very ripe bananas</li>
    

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
        <li>Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.</li>
        <li>Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.</li>
        <li>Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
